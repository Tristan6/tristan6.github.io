          I graduated from the University of
          Washington (Go Dawgs!) with a B.S. in Informatics in June 2020. I am currently working full-time for
          Icon Technologies as an Software Engineer. I'm always open to opportunities,
          especially any Full-Time Software Engineering or Back-End Development positions. My goal
          is to work for a utilitarian technology company creating products or services that
          respect peoples capabilities and care about their impact on the world. Click the
